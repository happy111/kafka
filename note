Brokers :-
Brokers are the core of a Kafka cluster and its connector to the outside world. A Kafka cluster is made up of one or more servers, called brokers. A broker is a container that holds several topics with their multiple partitions. Each broker has a certain number of topic partitions.


Topics  : -
A topic consists of multiple partitions distributed across brokers. A topic is a category that records data and publishes messages. Consumers can read the data written on them by subscribing to it.
